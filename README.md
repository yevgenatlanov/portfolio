# 🚀 The Most Lame-Engineered Portfolio Ever

This is my portfolio site, nothing to expect here.

## 🤔 Why This Exists. For real.

Because apparently i was bored enough.

## ✨ Features

Yes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Yes i know this is standart stack TS Nextjs and too much for the onepager. It's ok. I'm really sorry for this tailwind thing ... 🤦‍♂️

## 🤦‍♂️ Development Process

1. Decide to create a portfolio
2. Spend 3 weeks researching the "perfect layout"
3. Spend another few month thinking about style and personality while scrolling Pinterest / Behance.
4. Create 42 design mockups i didn't like.
5. Cry.
6. Implement basic version in 2 days
7. Finally deploy
8. Realize there's a typo in the header
9. Tilt.

## 🚨 Warning

This site contains dangerous levels of over-engineering. Side effects may include:

- Excessive load times for simple text
- Questioning why anyone needs 5MB of JavaScript to display a resume
